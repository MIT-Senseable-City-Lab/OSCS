Files for 3D printing, laser-cutting and the full CAD assembly.

A BoM (bill of materials) listing all the required parts and components to build a Flatburn enclosure can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oa0ZC6CXszNmvcmob7ju2rJUDLLGSCP4pCBNqtu63Sk/edit?usp=sharing)

Our prototypes were printed on a Flashforge Guider ii, but the files can be printed on most standard desktop 3D printers (e.g. Prusa i3, Ender 3, Ultimaker etc). See the BoM above for more details.
