Files for 3D printing, laser-cutting and the full CAD assembly.

A BoM (bill of materials) listing all the required parts and components to build a Flatburn enclosure is available [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qiVyINNuo0XEu6MasEJE_p4onlJh241j/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=118244402021817924300&rtpof=true&sd=true).

Our prototypes were printed on a Flashforge Guider ii, but the files can be printed on most standard desktop 3D printers (e.g. Prusa i3, Ender 3, Ultimaker etc). 

We suggest the following settings:

* Infill type: Triangular or Esagonal 
* Infill Percentage: at leat 50% 
* Layer height: this depend on the printer nozzle, I would go with the pre-defined setting.
