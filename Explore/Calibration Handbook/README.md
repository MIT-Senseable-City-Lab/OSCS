### Open-Source City Scanner Manual

The [City Scanner project](https://senseable.mit.edu/flatburn/) initiated by the [Senseable City Lab](https://senseable.mit.edu/) at MIT is a pioneer in mobile environment monitoring. It aims at developing a sensing platform to enable large scale environmental sensing tasks using existing urban fleets as sensing nodes. In general, City Scanner adopts a low-cost, modular design with [internet-of-things (IoT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_of_things) capabilities. However, Low-cost sensors suffer from constant data quality and stability issues. It is of utmost importance to perform proper data calibration and validation before making any conclusions or decisions based on the data.

We illustrate City Scanner version **Flatburn** 

In this folder, we present an open source [calibration manual](https://github.com/MIT-Senseable-City-Lab/OSCS/blob/main/Explore/Calibration%20Handbook/Calibration%20Handbook.pdf) to best assist our users in low-cost air sensor calibration, especially the use of City Scanner. We also provide [calibration codes](https://github.com/MIT-Senseable-City-Lab/OSCS/tree/main/Explore/Calibration%20Handbook/Calibration%20Code) that we used to demonstrate a standardized calibration process.
