In this folder, we present an open source [calibration manual](Explore/Calibration%20Handbook/Calibration%20Handbook.pdf) to best assist our users in low-cost air sensor calibration, especially the use of City Scanner. We also provide [calibration codes](Explore/Calibration%20Handbook/Calibration%20Code) that we used to demonstrate a standardized calibration process.
