This folder contains support files for the python coding activity, aiming to provide users with background information
and context on mobile air quality monitoring and environmental sensing. There are 2 files - a facilitator guide and
workshop slides. The facilitator guide is meant to support an individual or teaching team in combining these resources
to deliver during a class or workshop. The workshop slides are an educational presentation on the background of 
environmental sensing, mobile air quality monitoring, and CityScanner.
