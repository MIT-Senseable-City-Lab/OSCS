This folder contains support files for the python coding activity 

The coding activity presented students with
mobile air quality monitoring data and guided them through the process of
plotting time series and creating maps of of various parameters, including
temperature, humidity, and PM2.5.
The coding activity began by asking students to set up their coding en-
vironment, importing several python libraries, reading in the relevant data,
which was provided in a csv (comma-separated values) format, and setting
the local timezone. They were then asked to perform basic data cleaning
tasks, removing outlier values of temperature, humidity, and particulate mat-
ter data
