This folder contains support files for the python coding activity, aiming to provide users with background information and context on mobile air quality monitoring and environmental sensing, as well as teaching coding skills and analysis 
techniques, including:

- Using popular Python libraries such as Pandas to interact with data
- Creating time series graphs of measurements of environmental phenomena
- Creating python-based web maps using the Python [Leaflet.js](https://pypi.org/project/js.leaflet/) library

And more. There are 3 files in this directory - 2 facilitator guides and workshop slides. The facilitator guides are meant to support an individual or teaching team in combining these resources to deliver during a class or workshop. There is one version for a Python notebook that can be run in an environment of your choice, and one version to aid the facilitation of a Google CoLab notebook. The workshop slides 
are an educational presentation on the background of environmental sensing, mobile air quality monitoring, and the CityScanner platform.
