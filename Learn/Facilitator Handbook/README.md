This folder contains support files for the python coding activity, aiming to provide users with background information
and context on mobile air quality monitoring and environmental sensing, as well as teaching coding skills and analysis 
techniques, including:

- Using popular Python libraries such as Pandas to interact with data
- Creating time series graphs of measurements of environmental phenomena
- Creating python-based web maps using the Python Leaflet.js library

And more. There are 2 files in this directory - a facilitator guide and workshop slides. The facilitator guide is meant 
to support an individual or teaching team in combining these resources to deliver during a class or workshop. The 
workshop slides are an educational presentation on the background of environmental sensing, mobile air quality 
monitoring, and CityScanner.
