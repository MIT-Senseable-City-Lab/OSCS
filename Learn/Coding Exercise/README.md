This folder contains a coding activity written in Python to introduce users to air quality and environmental sensing methods
by working with CityScanner Data, exploring time series analysis, geospatial analysis, and pollution hotspot analysis.
There are 2 versions: 
- One is a `.ipynb` file containing python code and some descriptive text, which can be run in an environment of your choosing.
- The other is a `.ipynb` file intended to be run on the [Google CoLab](https://colab.research.google.com/) platform. 

The notebooks provide sample code to run with New York City Deployment data, which can be edited to use different data files we provide in [explore/datasets](Explore/Datasets).

Please refer to the [facilitator handbook](/Learn/Facilitator%20Handbook) for further instructions.
