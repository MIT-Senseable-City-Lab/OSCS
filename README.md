Part of the [City Scanner project](https://senseable.mit.edu/cityscanner/), Flatburn is an open-source mobile sensing platform that collects various environmental data which generate a new real-time map of sensed data, building on existing fleets.

## Build

 - [/hardware](https://github.com/MIT-Senseable-City-Lab/OSCS/tree/main/Build/Hardware): The fabrication files for Flatburn include `.stl` files for [3D printing](https://github.com/MIT-Senseable-City-Lab/OSCS/tree/main/Build/Hardware/Hardware%20enclosure/To%20Print), `.dxf` files for [laser cutting](https://github.com/MIT-Senseable-City-Lab/OSCS/tree/main/Build/Hardware/Hardware%20enclosure/To%20lasercut), and a `.step` file showing the full [assembly](https://github.com/MIT-Senseable-City-Lab/OSCS/blob/main/Build/Hardware/Hardware%20enclosure/Flatburn_assembly.step), `.csv` file with bill of materials for the [mechanical components](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oa0ZC6CXszNmvcmob7ju2rJUDLLGSCP4pCBNqtu63Sk/edit?usp=sharing).
The [hardware schematics](https://github.com/MIT-Senseable-City-Lab/OSCS/tree/main/Build/Hardware/Hardware%20schematics) folder contains `.brb` files for the main-board and the sensor-board which can be viewed using [Cadence](https://www.cadence.com/en_US/home/tools/pcb-design-and-analysis/allegro-downloads-start.html) free viewer, schematics of the PCB in `.pdf` format,`.csv` file with bill of materials for the electronics components.

## Learn
- [/coding exercise](https://github.com/MIT-Senseable-City-Lab/OSCS/tree/main/Learn/Coding%20Exercise): The coding activity written in Python to introduce users to air quality and environmental sensing methods by working with CityScanner Data, exploring time series analysis, geospatial analysis, and pollution hotspot analysis.
- [/facilitator handbook](https://github.com/MIT-Senseable-City-Lab/OSCS/tree/main/Learn/Facilitator%20Handbook): The guide and educational slide gives users background information on air pollutants, environmental sensing, and an overview of the CityScanner device.Â
